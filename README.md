# ff8-memory-reader
Reads specific memory addresses from FF8_EN (PC non-remaster).

I made this to display real-time stats from the game during my Twitch stream.

All of the information I started with was from free resources on the internet (see credits below) most of which were passion projects from other FF8 fans. I want to continue the trend of free information, hence this repo. Research exists to be shared.

## TO DO
